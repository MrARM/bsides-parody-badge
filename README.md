 # The "SUPER OFFICIAL" Party Crasher Badge for BSidesKC

 This is a Badge I came up with as a fun idea before BSidesKC 2021.

 There was a very limited run(5 badges) available at BSidesKC. 2022 will probably be something a bit more smart if I can secure a supply.

 ## Notes on the BSidesKC 2021 run

 Of the 5 badges made, there was an issue with a short on the battery terminal, the likely cause of this was a mistake when adjusting which layer a silkscreen should've gone on. This version on github has been modified to resolve this issue.

 Due to that, the option of a switch on the board was removed as it was a suitable point to install the battery.
